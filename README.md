A sample app written for Venminder 

It is hard to know how much time to use or what areas to focus on.  
For example, I just did another "project" for an interview where they wanted to see a multithreaded async node program to handle message processing with scalable thread count.   They suggested I take 3 or 4 hours.  I wrote what I think was an elegant version that focused on resource monitoring (in addition to processing the messages) since this is an important server topic.  But the UI wasn't great - it used a command line interface.  They were unhappy that the UI was so primitive.  It was primitive but given the specs I thought what I did was appropriate.  IMHO they should have not have been surprised given the specs they provided.

In this case I allocated 4 hour and spent 5. 
I decided to show a variety of skills based on my discussion with Kanal.
1) First, the scoring algorithm works correctly
2) Shows use of angular with components and modern scss using grid
3) Shows typical app layout (header, sidebar, footer, etc) 
4) The interface is somewhat primitve regarding entry of scores 

Thank you for the opportunity.  I look forwrd to hearing from you.
